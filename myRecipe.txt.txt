You can also directly add grated potatoes in the pan to avoid the switching off and on of the flame.
*TIP: use boiled potatoes that are refrigerated for at least 1-2 hours.
• Take the aloo mixture off from the heat and transfer it in a bowl.
• Wash the poha with water and rest for 4-5 minutes to soften, keep it aside to add in aloo mixture.
• further add, soften poha, freshly chopped coriander leaves and lemon juice, mix and combine well, further cool down the mixture to the room temperature.
• Use a cling wrap, butter paper or a foil paper and transfer the potato mixture over the cling wrap, roll tightly and shape it in big size sausage, make sure it should be slightly smaller than your burger buns in diameter, set it in the freezer for 2-3 hours.
• Take out the aloo mixture from the freezer and slice into 1 cm thick disc. And keep aside for coating.
• For slurry, take a mixing bowl and add refined flour, cornstarch and Salt & pepper to taste, mix well and add water to make a semi thick slurry.
• To coat the aloo tikki, first coat it with refined flour and pat & shake to remove excess flour, then dip it in the slurry and coat it well, further coat it with dry seasoned bread crumbs (add salt & black pepper to taste), pat & shake to remove extra crumbs. Follow the same step to coat each aloo tikki. 
*Tip: make these tikkis and store them in freezer for up to 15 days. Don’t forget to thaw before frying.
• Set oil for deep frying on medium high heat and fry the tikkis until they are crisp and golden brown. You can also choose to air fry them or bake them at 200°C for 7- 8 minutes on both the sides.
